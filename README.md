# Data Science Certificate Project

This project serves as the final project to complete my professional Data Science certificate from IBM. 
It encompasses a collection of Jupyter Notebooks, each focusing on different aspects of data science.

## Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to apply data science techniques and methodologies to analyze and gain insights from various datasets. 
The project is developed for a startup called "SpaceY" aiming to compete against SpaceX, owned by Elon Musk. 
The main objective is to predict the successful landing of the first stage of the rocket.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into multiple Jupyter Notebooks, each dedicated to a specific area of data science. The notebooks cover topics such as data collection, data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning modeling, and visualization.
