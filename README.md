# Data Science Certificate Project

This project serves as the final project to complete my professional Data Science certificate from IBM. 
It encompasses a collection of Jupyter Notebooks, each focusing on different aspects of data science.

## Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to apply data science techniques and methodologies to analyze and gain insights from various datasets. 
The project is developed for a startup called "SpaceY" aiming to compete against SpaceX, owned by Elon Musk. 
The main objective is to predict the successful landing of the first stage of the rocket.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into multiple Jupyter Notebooks, each dedicated to a specific area of data science. The notebooks cover topics such as data collection, data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning modeling, and visualization.

## Notebooks
- [Notebook 1: Data Collection](link_to_notebook_1)

- [Notebook 3: Exploratory Data Analysis](link_to_notebook_3)
- [Notebook 4: Machine Learning Modeling](link_to_notebook_4)
- [Notebook 5: Data Visualization](link_to_notebook_5)
- [Notebook 5: Launch Site Analysis with Folium](https://nbviewer.org/github/LcsSlv/RocketLandingPredictor/blob/main/Launch%20Site%20Analysis%20with%20Folium.ipynb)

Feel free to explore each notebook to gain insights into the data science techniques and methodologies used throughout the project.

## Requirements
To run the notebooks locally, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can refer to the requirements.txt file for the specific packages and versions required.
